		"text": " UK. Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge Co . have teamed up to develop an innovative, ultra-low temperature pod to transport and store Covid-19 vaccines globally to meet the challenge of vaccinating patients around the world in nearly any environment. The new ArcticRx system will help bridge the gap in the cold chain currently challenging the global vaccination effort. ArcticRx is a passive, stable, long-term ultra-low temperature (ULT) pod — the first of its kind to support a two-dose vaccine delivery regimen specifically targeting rural, remote and international areas in support of global equitable access and to help share doses as rapidly and quickly as possible. Allen Barta, Rolls-Royce, Emerging Technologies and Innovation Lead, said, “This new vaccine delivery system developed jointly by Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge will solve the significant technological challenge of maintaining extremely low vaccine temperatures. Vaccines need to be kept ultra cold and for long enough to transport them worldwide – and not just one, but two doses of vaccines. Rolls-Royce is proud to bring our innovation to bear on this difficult and crucial challenge, and join ChefsFridge in the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.” The ArcticRx pod was designed by Rolls-Royce innovators in Indianapolis and developed with ChefsFridge, also based nearby. The collaboration has led to a final design, with three models manufactured and tested. With the ability to scale quickly with funding, ChefsFridge Co. is currently seeking investment and manufacturing partners as the team moves forward to market. As COVID-19 vaccines began to roll out, gaps were found in the system for transporting and storing the doses of vaccines. Current solutions are still expensive, bulky, and inaccessible to many regions without resources like electricity and ultra-low temperature storage at vaccination sites. Most current shipping coolers are only able to carry one of two rounds of doses at a time, causing logistics and sustainability issues. The ArcticRx is reusable, lightweight, and does not require electricity to maintain stable ultra-low temperatures required for mRNA vaccines. ArcticRx can be refilled with additional cooling materials. Rolls-Royce engineers in the company’s LibertyWorks advanced technology unit in Indianapolis designed the system to solve the challenge. The company then connected with ChefsFridge, a company creating an asynchronous meal-sharing platform along with exact temperature-controlled kiosks to provide a 365/24/7 neighborhood focused food sharing. Stuart Lowry, ChefsFridge Co-founder, said, “From the beginning it seemed a natural fit for our creative approach at ChefsFridge Co. The passion from the team at Rolls-Royce melded seamlessly with our energy for creating a way to help with the pandemic, using the toolbox of cooling engineers, innovation, and the build-it-from-scratch approach. It was not only exciting, but possibly revolutionary, in terms of solving this vital cold chain issue.” M. Shane Bivens, ChefsFridge Co-founder, said, “People think the problem is over, but we’re not even close. Initially, we’re looking at immediate global challenges that need to be met. With the help we’re seeking from additional investors and manufacturing partners, the possibilities from this point are enormous for both solving this current pandemic, and shipping and storing other vital medical and non-medical supplies. There are so many life improving medications pharma leaves on the shelf because stable cold chain transportation for extended time periods did not previously exist to move product around the globe.”",

		"text": "It’s no secret that the bloom is off the rose in legacy tech hubs where congestion, living expenses, and difficulty making a name for yourself (along with the rise in remote work) are fueling an exodus as tech workers and entrepreneurs seek better lives and careers. Indiana is perfectly positioned to attract people who are looking to leave overcrowded areas. For entrepreneurs thinking it’s time for a better life in the Heartland, Indiana and its capital city Indianapolis offer the following: Indianapolis is a mid-sized city with huge reach and great quality of life Tech is thriving in the Indy metro as well as in smaller cities like Bloomington, Terre Haute, Evansville and South Bend that are short drives away. Eighty percent of the country is within a day’s drive of Indianapolis, which boasts the best airport in the country. You take home way more of your paycheck here. You can own a home without going massively in debt. Your commute will have less congestion/traffic to fight. You can send your kids to better schools, and for employers, there are huge cost savings ($24M/yr) and a reduction in employee churn rates compared to legacy tech hubs. Indiana is a legit tech hub The city is home to Salesforce’s Marketing Cloud HQ, Infosys’ Technology & Innovation hub. Multiple (and growing) subsectors in cyber security, edge computing, sports tech and ed tech. Companies like Genesys, Jobvite, UKG and Tangoe that were involved in mergers and acquisitions chose Indy as their HQ or key tech centers rather than other cities where they were active. Companies like ActiveCampaign, Celigo, UGroup, and Wunderkind chose Indy to greatly expand their operations. Indiana has a thriving startup community with venture capital Startup activity here is hot and supported by nationally recognized organizations like High Alpha’s venture studio, two Techstars accelerators, Elevate Ventures and the state’s Next Level Fund. Indianapolis is close to top research universities The Talent Pool is robust and many tech entrepreneurs who’ve been successful stay to spin out new ventures. Top business and engineering schools like Purdue University, Indiana University, University of Notre Dame and Rose-Hulman Institute of Technology produce thousands of young tech leaders each year, and unique internship programs and talent pipelines served by TechPoint and others are working hard to retain those students. Access to a deep talent pool is commonly cited by companies that have moved here, including UGroup, one of the area’s newest tech companies to expand to Indy specifically because of the “ thriving tech climate and talent pool.” Indiana has serious B2B SaaS strength Having Salesforce’s Marketing Cloud HQ here deepened Indy’s reputation as a Martech town. Companies that work with Salesforce have clustered here, along with others that are breaking new ground in the subsectors. Indiana is much more than just Martech Other sectors also offer tech careers because tech is intersecting with every business now. Advanced Manufacturing (think Cummins, Rolls Royce, Raytheon, Subaru, etc…) Life Sciences (Lilly, Elanco, Regenstrief, Cook Medical) Ag Tech and Sports (NCAA, Colts, Pacers, Indy 500.) Indiana has the quality of life tech talent wants People who’ve never been to Indy are always surprised at how our Downtown has a big city feel, but the overall community still has a bit of small town charm. It’s an easy drive, walk, bike to just about any other part of the city. Nationally ranked museums, hotels, a great culinary scene, and sporting events are here. You can find some glimpses of that in our “ Wish You Were Here ” campaign. Amenities aside, an intangible but important factor is the opportunity to come in and be a big fish, to get involved and make an impact, even if you didn’t grow up here. It’s harder to get access to opportunity in a big city. Mid-sized cities often have a “where did you go to high school” clique-ishness. That’s not as present here Indy. Indiana has long been considered a top destination point for affordability, friendliness, quality of life and work/life balance reasons. As the tech sector continues to expand across so many subsectors, that list is increasingly including great career opportunities as well.

		"text": "INDIANAPOLIS - Rolls-Royce Corp. in Indianapolis is partnering with Anderson-based startup ChefsFridge Co. to develop a novel way to store and transport COVID-19 vaccines. The ArcticRx system is an ultra-low temperature pod that the partners say is the first of its kind to support the delivery of a two-dose vaccine regimen, specifically to rural, remote and international areas. The companies say the pod will help bridge a gap in the cold chain that is currently challenging the global vaccination effort. In an interview with Inside INdiana Business, ChefsFridge co-founder Shane Bivens says the cold chain doesn't go as far as one might expect. \"A lot of the delivery of vaccines or anything that needs to be stored at ultra-low temperatures...that's not extremely common in the rest of the world,\" said Bivens. \"What we see out there is that in order to get a vaccine to someone's arm, it might take 12 different groups in order to be able to take that package off of an airplane or a ship and then ultimately get it to a person. So we wanted to look at could we just send one box that could be dispersed from one area and go out to serve smaller populations, as well as larger populations, and serve them over the entire time they would need to vaccinate.\" The ArcticRx pod was designed by Rolls-Royce in Indy and developed by ChefsFridge. Most current shipping coolers, according to ChefsFridge, are expensive, bulky, and only able to carry one round of vaccine doses at a time, whereas the ArcticRx pod is lightweight, can carry both vaccine doses, and does not require electricity to maintain the necessary ultra-low temperatures. \"At ultra-low temperature, you've got to use dry ice or other materials that can get to that temperature,\" said Bivens. \"Right now, most devices, you have about 3-5 days before you got to keep replenishing that dry ice within that container, whereas (with ArcticRx), you're going through an entire vaccination cycle without having to replenish.\" ChefsFridge co-founder Stuart Lowry says the stability of the temperature within the pod, which measures about 30 inches square, is key. Bivens says they have three prototypes manufactured and tested and the next step is to secure funding and manufacturing partners to bring the pod to market. He says the company has been able to leverage some of its existing relationships with manufacturers, but also find some new ones. \"I think probably the most interesting thing of this entire story, at least for me, is can you actually do something this advanced and find the experts in the world...can you find them when you're in the Midwest? And, we keep finding out that when we search for the experts, we keep finding them in Indiana or the surrounding area. It's been an amazingly heartwarming and enlightening experience to see how much expertise resides within this local area.\" Bivens says the company is now working with manufacturers to determine the overall cost of the pods and how much funding needs to be raised to help bring the pods to market. Lowry says being such a young startup creates advantages in speed and agility. \"That's one of the reasons why Rolls wisely picked a partner in the startup world,\" said Lowry. \"So even though we're starting at ground zero, we can go quickly. So, if we can get the right partners and get the right things lined up, as a startup and as someone with dramatic and really extensive contacts across the state right now that can help with this project, we can make this happen very quickly versus a larger company.\" Bivens says if the company can secure the necessary funding and begin manufacturing, the ArcticRx pods can begin shipping with vaccines around the globe in a matter of months. Aside from the ArcticRx system, ChefsFridge is developing an asynchronous platform to allow for peer-to-peer food sharing within neighborhoods, particularly those facing food insecurity. \"We're all about food equity. So, looking at equity for vaccine delivery really is a perfect match for what we do and how we approach our business,\" said Lowry.",

It’s not every day that you can say that the work you do helps keep the UK safe, but that is just one of the unique benefits of securing a role within Rolls-Royce Submarines. Founded in 1906, and quickly gaining a reputation for making the most famous cars and engines in the world, Rolls-Royce has evolved to a global provider of power to multiple customers across the world, and is now recognised as one of the world’s leading manufacturers of gas-turbine power systems for use on land, sea and in the air. However, for over sixty years Rolls-Royce has been quietly designing, manufacturing and supporting in-service, the reactor plant that power the Royal Navy’s nuclear submarine fleet, while at the same time gaining a reputation as a provider of solutions for the civil nuclear industry. Throughout this time, the company has been at the forefront of Britain’s nuclear power research and has played a key role in developing the country’s nuclear engineering capability. Because of the classified nature of most of this work, much has gone unreported, and though many residents of Derby will know of this association, very few in the country are fully aware of the Rolls-Royce nuclear power connection. Since the late 1950’s, Rolls-Royce has designed, supplied and supported the nuclear plant that power and propel all of the UK Royal Navy's nuclear submarines. Rolls-Royce Submarines Ltd is responsible for delivering the Nuclear Steam Raising Plant (NSRP), plus parts of the secondary propulsion systems to the UK Ministry of Defence. A workforce of over 3000, based primarily in Derby, also manage these assets across their full lifecycle. This includes providing frontline support across the world for Royal Navy submarine reactor plant equipment from the Company’s Operations Centre in Derby. They also support the submarines when in the Barrow-in-Furness shipyard and the naval bases at Devonport and Faslane. You will have the ability to apply appropriate environmental conditions to components through life (i.e. from supplier production and delivery to Rolls-Royce production, in service through to predicted / actual end of life) and therefore provide guidance on the appropriateness of a given component for its intended application. Have a good understanding of component counterfeit avoidance and obsolesce issues. Be able to support supplier audits to assure compliance. Have an understanding of Physics of Failure at component level. Key Accountabilities Key Experiences and any Qualifications We offer excellent development, a competitive salary and exceptional benefits. These include bonus, employee support assistance and employee discounts. Pioneer the performance of the future. Join us and you’ll develop your skills and expertise to the very highest levels, working in an international environment for a company known the world over for brilliance and innovation.

		"text": "WEST LAFAYETTE - Rolls-Royce Corp. in Indianapolis has announced a multi-million-dollar investment in its testing operations at the Purdue Aerospace District in West Lafayette. The company says the facilities will be used to test high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines for the next generation of U.S. military aircraft. The Purdue Research Foundation says the project will include three brand new facilities and an expansion of one existing building, totaling an estimated 50,000 square feet of new space. One of the new facilities will be a high-altitude test cell, which Rolls-Royce says will be able to simulate conditions of flight on an engine while it is still physically on the ground. The company says it will use the facility to test a variety of current and future engines for military aircraft such as the V-22 Ospreay, the C130J Super Hercules, and the Bell V-280 Valor. Warren White, head of assembly and test for Rolls-Royce Defense in Indy, says Rolls-Royce currently has a high-altitude test cell at its campus in Indianapolis. \"By choosing to put that kind of conditioning facility [at Purdue], we can double our research. The university can do better research with it there,\" said White. \"It's a subset of the testing we do. All of the production and the manufacturing testing, which is primarily the testing we do, still resides in Indianapolis. This is a unique test cell that has unique environmental conditions...and putting that on in a research area makes the most sense for what the state, what the university, what Rolls-Royce can get out of it.\" Rolls-Royce says the new test campus will expand its ability to test hybrid-electric technologies, such as directed energy, batteries, thermal management, generators and power electronics. The project is also part of the company's goal of reaching net-zero carbon status by 2030. White says while there are no specific job numbers associated with the project, the company is always on the hunt for new talent. \"Certainly, working with the economic area like Lafayette, West Lafayette, Tippecanoe County and the region surrounding that, [there is] a lot of talent in that region. Certainly, the university attracts a lot of that and so we will be working closely with the folks we will be adding in up in that space. New work usually brings new jobs. We're bidding on a lot of new work and these facilities are going to help us get that new work and then therefore, those new jobs in those areas.\" White says ground could be broken on the project within the next year or two and be complete in phases by 2024. The partners are still finalizing the timeline for construction. While financial details are not being disclosed, Rolls-Royce says it will primarily fund the project, with support from Purdue and the Purdue Research Foundation. “Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,\" Purdue President Mitch Daniels said in a news release. \"With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.” Rolls-Royce recently completed at $600 million modernization of its Indianapolis manufacturing campus. Tom Bell, chief executive officer of Rolls-Royce North America, says the company is also planning \"significant investment\" into its test facilities in Indy.",

The enhanced partnership, announced Monday, details how Rolls-Royce will expand its facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District, near Purdue University. In a pre-announcement call Friday with the Journal & Courier and other media, the partners did not specify the financial impact of the expansion, only defining the commitment in multi-million dollars. The expansion is defined as \"significant,\" Rolls-Royce announced, \"in the tens of thousands\" of square footage. Rolls-Royce already fills the 55,000-square-foot facility of Purdue Technology Center Aerospace, at 1801 Newman Rd., an operation announced in March 2017. The new test facilities, the partners announced, will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines for U.S. military aircraft. “Rolls-Royce has a proud history of supporting our U.S. military and commercial customers, and this new significant investment will continue to grow our capability to serve our customers,\" Tom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America, said. \"This reflects yet another major investment in Indiana, and we are also planning significant upgrades to test facilities at our Indianapolis manufacturing campus, which has benefited from a recently completed $600 million modernization program to grow advanced manufacturing and technology capability. We thank both local and state governments for their ongoing support.” The partnership, a release from Rolls-Royce stated, \"is a major win for the national security and technology pillar of Purdue’s Next Moves,\" announced by Purdue President Mitch Daniels and Purdue trustees in April. “Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,” Daniels said at the time. “With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls-Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.” Rolls-Royce employs hundreds of Purdue engineers already, and the expansion would inject more employment opportunities into the mix, the company added. \"Rolls-Royce is always looking for new talent,\" Warren White of Rolls-Royce said Friday, \"a lot of talent in that region, and certainly the university draws that kind of talent. We are bidding on a lot of new work, and these facilities will help us get new work.\" Mung Chiang, Purdue’s executive vice president for strategic initiatives and the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering, said testing to be conducted by Rolls-Royce will advance national security. \"Today’s announcement is pivotal for two reasons,\" Chiang said in the release. \"It represents the largest single economic development success to our neighborhood with Rolls-Royce colleagues and the largest research collaboration with a private sector partner. It also advances the excellence at scale by Purdue in creating the epicenter of aerospace engineering (research and development) in the U.S.\" The expansion and continued investment advances the Purdue mission, said Brian Edelman, Purdue Research Foundation president. \"The foundation supports President Daniels' vision to establish the university as a leader among institutes of higher education in the realm of national security,\" Edelman said. \"The investment to expand Rolls-Royce's presence in the Purdue Aerospace District is a strategic one that will make the vision become a reality, and lead to more actions in the same initiative. The generous support from Lafayette, Greater Lafayette Commerce, and West Lafayette provide another example of the strong ecosystem we are building with community, university and corporate partners.”",

On Monday, Purdue announced that Rolls-Royce will expand its facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District. According to a press release, the new test facilities will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines to power the next generation of U.S. military aircraft. Rolls-Royce West Lafayette will be developed through a multimillion-dollar investment from the research foundation, Purdue University and Rolls-Royce North America. “Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,” President Mitch Daniels said. “With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls-Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.” The Rolls-Royce facility already employs hundreds of Purdue engineers, focuses on digital engine controls and conducts advanced technology engine research at Purdue's Zucrow Laboratories in the district. Tom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce has a proud history of supporting our U.S. military and commercial customers, and this new significant investment will continue to grow our capability to serve our customers. This reflects yet another major investment in Indiana, and we are also planning significant upgrades to test facilities at our Indianapolis manufacturing campus, which has benefited from a recently completed $600 million modernization program to grow advanced manufacturing and technology capability. We thank both local and state governments for their ongoing support.” Mung Chiang, Purdue’s executive vice president for strategic initiatives and the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering, said testing to be conducted by Rolls-Royce will substantially advance national security. \"Today’s announcement is pivotal for two reasons,\" Chiang said. \"It represents the largest single economic development success to our neighborhood with Rolls-Royce colleagues and the largest research collaboration with a private-sector partner. It also advances the excellence at scale by Purdue in creating the epicenter of aerospace engineering R&D in the U.S.\" Related Content - [Rolls-Royce at Purdue announces expansion of facilities] - [NHK Seating of America announce $38M expansion to Frankfort facility] - [SIA rolls out $158M expansion plan] - [Purdue rolls over Illinois 46-7] - [Indiana school voucher expansion rolled back in Senate plan] - [Purdue to roll out new Identification cards] - [McLaughlin, Purdue roll past Western Kentucky 67-50] - [Purdue to make announcement regarding Purdue NewU] - [Purdue announce new Protect Purdue Health Center] - [New facility coming to Purdue's Wildlife Area]",

		"text": "Rolls-Royce expanding research footprint at Purdue University [Alexandria Burris] Rolls-Royce announced on Monday plans to expand its footprint at Purdue University with the construction of three new testing facilities for high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines . Rolls-Royce West Lafayette will be developed at the Purdue Aerospace District, just off the university campus. The company already has facilities focusing on digital engine controls and conducts advanced technology engine research at the university’s Zucrow Propulsion Labs . Rolls-Royce: [to shrink downtown Indianapolis footprint as it rethinks post-pandemic work](/story/money/2021/06/28/rolls-royce-indianapolis-shrink-office-space/5344339001/) Rolls-Royce currently conducts high-altitude testing in Indianapolis but plans to move those operations to West Lafayette. That facility was built in the 1950s, said Warren White, head of assembly and testing at Rolls-Royce Defense. It was unclear immediately what the impact of jobs would be in Indianapolis. \"The high altitude testing, there's a few spots we have done that in Indianapolis,\" White said. \"This is a new investment, recapitalization that we need to do from some old facilities we have. It is consistent work that we do when qualifying any new engine. We need to renew that capability and we're choosing to, with that development work, put that unique capability up in aerospace district.\" The bulk of Rolls-Royce testing will remain in Indianapolis, White said. The high-altitude test cell has unique environmental conditions related to creating air that makes an engine feel like its flying. \"Together with the university and the labs that we use of there already. They use small amounts of that air. By choosing to put that kind of conditioning facility up there, we can double our research,\" he said.

Rolls-Royce recently told its employees [that its shrinking the size of its footprint](/story/money/2021/06/28/rolls-royce-indianapolis-shrink-office-space/5344339001/) downtown Indianapolis and consolidating its operations into one building at existing Meridian Center campus. In addition to the downtown campus, Rolls-Royce has several sites in and around Indianapolis. The new facilities in West Lafayette will be funded primarily by Rolls-Royce, with support from Purdue University and the Purdue Research Foundation. Both the company and the university declined to disclose the total cost of the project and the how much each entity is contributing. The expansion, which also includes the adding square feet to an existing building, is estimated to total a combined 50,000 square feet. Rolls-Royce has yet to set a construction timeline but expects the work to take place over the next several years. White said certain facilities will open next year while others will fully open at the start of 2024.

		"text": "Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge to Design Cold Pods for Vaccine Transport Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge Co. have teamed up to develop an innovative, ultra-low temperature pod to transport and store Covid-19 vaccines globally to meet the challenge of vaccinating patients around the world in nearly any environment. The new ArcticRx system will help bridge the gap in the cold chain currently challenging the global vaccination effort. ArcticRx is a passive, stable, long-term ultra-low temperature (ULT) pod -- the first of its kind to support a two-dose vaccine delivery regimen specifically targeting rural, remote and international areas in support of global equitable access and to help share doses as rapidly and quickly as possible. Allen Barta, Rolls-Royce, Emerging Technologies and Innovation Lead, said: “This new vaccine delivery system developed jointly by Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge will solve the significant technological challenge of maintaining extremely low vaccine temperatures. \"Vaccines need to be kept ultra cold and for long enough to transport them worldwide – and not just one, but two doses of vaccines. Rolls-Royce is proud to bring our innovation to bear on this difficult and crucial challenge, and join ChefsFridge in the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.” Rolls-Royce to Explore Uses of Nuclear Power for Space Exploration The ArcticRx pod was designed by Rolls-Royce innovators in Indianapolis and developed with ChefsFridge, also based nearby. The collaboration has led to a final design, with three models manufactured and tested. With the ability to scale quickly with funding, ChefsFridge Co. is currently seeking investment and manufacturing partners as the team moves forward to market. The ArcticRx is reusable, lightweight, and does not require electricity to maintain stable ultra-low temperatures required for mRNA vaccines. ArcticRx can be refilled with additional cooling materials. Rolls-Royce engineers in the company’s LibertyWorks advanced technology unit in Indianapolis designed the system to solve the challenge. The company then connected with ChefsFridge, a company creating an asynchronous meal-sharing platform along with exact temperature-controlled kiosks to provide a 365/24/7 neighborhood focused food sharing. Stuart Lowry, ChefsFridge co-founder, said: \"From the beginning it seemed a natural fit for our creative approach at ChefsFridge Co. The passion from the team at Rolls-Royce melded seamlessly with our energy for creating a way to help with the pandemic.\" M. Shane Bivens, ChefsFridge co-founder, said: “People think the problem is over, but we’re not even close. Initially, we’re looking at immediate global challenges that need to be met. \"With the help we’re seeking from additional investors and manufacturing partners, the possibilities from this point are enormous for both solving this current pandemic, and shipping and storing other vital medical and non-medical supplies.\" Read More: Rolls-Royce Tests 100% Sustainable Aviation Fuel for Business Jets",

		"text": "A Who’s Who of Indiana’s High-Tech Companies You’ve likely heard the names of several of Indiana’s prominent high-tech companies, but it’s a safe bet you haven’t come to understand all the incredible things they do. There’s a lot of variety throughout the state’s cutting-edge businesses. Many are developing things that could change the future. We’d like to give you a little 411 on several leading advanced technology organizations to show you just how much of a powerhouse Indiana has become. Each of the following are conducting some of the coolest activities you haven’t learned about yet. NSWC Crane Naval Surface Warfare Center, Crane Division ( NSWC Crane ) in Martin County is the third-largest naval installation in the world, and it’s got some massive brainpower to boot. The facility employs 2,500 scientists, engineers, and technicians, plus over 1,300 additional employees that all work to provide technical solutions to America’s warfighters. NSWC Crane researchers are developing technology for things like missile defense systems, electronic warfare systems, infrared and laser countermeasures, and so much more. The facility also has space to train and equip elite Special Operations warriors. Purdue Research Park Purdue Research Park (PRF) is the largest university-affiliated business incubation complex in the country, according to state officials. Over 300 companies operate out of the various PRF locations in Indiana. These companies are working on all kinds of things like advanced medicines, agricultural innovations, logistics, early childhood development, battery power and storage, sustainable manufacturing, biologics, and so much more we couldn’t possibly fit it all here. Basically, the important thing to know about PRF is that its affiliated companies make breakthroughs happen every day. Rolls-Royce Rolls-Royce is a global company, but did you know that more of their products are built at their Indianapolis location than anywhere else in the world? Bet you didn’t. The company makes engines – serious engines. Like the kind found on the U.S. Air Force’s B-52 strategic bomber fleet and the Navy’s V-22 Osprey . These aren’t just the kind of aircraft you’d see in Hollywood movies, they’re the real-deal machines that help keep our military a superior force on all battlefronts. And what keeps it all moving? Hardworking Hoosier-made horsepower. AgReliant Genetics There are 11 Midwestern research facilities in the AgReliant Genetics family, plus additional sites all around the world. They are finding new ways to make farmers especially happy with bigger crop yields and more robust plants. In Westfield, IN, AgReliant’s research program includes corn, soybean, alfalfa, and sorghum, which is a grain often used in livestock feed. The company’s plants are bred to be more adaptable to environmental changes and health concerns – which means less risk for agriculture businesses and more opportunities to feed the world. MarketCast The better anyone can understand their audience, the more they’ll be able to engage them. Through data science and real-time analytics, Indianapolis-based MarketCast ( previously Fizziology , prior to 2017) studies the minds of audiences. The company works for entities like leading Hollywood movie studios, video game publishers, lifestyle brands, and even sports teams. Very big names. MarketCast’s technology can analyze social media conversations, study human reactions to things, and can measure engagements. Roughly 1.2 billion social conversations are monitored and analyzed across digital and platforms annually by their software. Roche Diagnostics Roche Diagnostics is a global company, but they have a major presence in Central Indiana with about 4,500 jobs . The company makes products that help diagnose diseases, including conditions like cancers, cardiac issues, infectious diseases, diabetes, and more. Also, the company was actively involved in developing COVID-19 testing materials last year.

		"text": "WEST LAFAYETTE, Ind. — Aerospace engine manufacturing giant Rolls-Royce will expand its already large footprint at Purdue, thanks to a new commitment among the university, the Purdue Research Foundation and the company.\nThe enhanced partnership, announced Monday (Aug. 2), calls for Rolls-Royce to further expand its facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District, which is adjacent to the university. The new test facilities will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines to power the next generation of U.S. military aircraft. Rolls-Royce West Lafayette will be developed through a multimillion-dollar investment from the research foundation, Purdue University and Rolls-Royce North America.\nThe partnership is a major win for the national security and technology pillar of Purdue’s Next Moves , announced by President Mitch Daniels and Purdue trustees in April.\n“Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,” Daniels said. “With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls-Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.”\nRolls-Royce already has facilities focusing on digital engine controls and conducts advanced technology engine research at Purdue's Zucrow Laboratories in the district. It’s part of a longstanding partnership between the company and university spanning several decades of conducting aerospace research. The company also employs hundreds of Purdue engineers.\nThe facility will enable Rolls-Royce North America to continue its legacy of providing full-service advanced design, development, production and aftermarket support of world-leading propulsion solutions.\nTom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce has a proud history of supporting our U.S. military and commercial customers, and this new significant investment will continue to grow our capability to serve our customers. This reflects yet another major investment in Indiana, and we are also planning significant upgrades to test facilities at our Indianapolis manufacturing campus, which has benefited from a recently completed $600 million modernization program to grow advanced manufacturing and technology capability. We thank both local and state governments for their ongoing support.”\nMung Chiang, Purdue’s executive vice president for strategic initiatives and the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering, said testing to be conducted by Rolls-Royce will substantially advance national security.\n\"Today’s announcement is pivotal for two reasons,\" Chiang said. \"It represents the largest single economic development success to our neighborhood with Rolls-Royce colleagues and the largest research collaboration with a private-sector partner. It also advances the excellence at scale by Purdue in creating the epicenter of aerospace engineering R&D in the U.S.\"\nTheresa Mayer, Purdue University executive vice president for research and partnerships, said, “We look forward to having deeper engagement with Rolls-Royce as part of Purdue’s rapidly growing defense research and technology ecosystem. The researchers working in these facilities will be able to leverage the deep expertise of our faculty and staff, as well as our new and existing facilities for research, design, testing and evaluation.”\nBrian Edelman, Purdue Research Foundation president, said the investment fits PRF's goal to advance the mission of Purdue University.\n\"The foundation supports President Daniels' vision to establish the university as a leader among institutes of higher education in the realm of national security,\" Edelman said. \"The investment to expand Rolls-Royce's presence in the Purdue Aerospace District is a strategic one that will make the vision become a reality, and lead to more actions in the same initiative. The generous support from Lafayette, Greater Lafayette Commerce, West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County provides another example of the strong ecosystem we are building with community, university and corporate partners.”\n",

		"text": " Rolls-Royce will be the founding industry member of the new Hypersonics Ground Test Center (HGTC) at Purdue University, a national testing facility for the aerospace industry. The new test center will support US national defense strategy and bring together many aerospace companies to enhance their test capability. The US Department of Defense considers hypersonic capability a major priority, with seven active key rapid prototyping projects in works, a combined $3 Billion in annual funding, and the Joint Hypersonics Transition Office set up to coordinate efforts. Rolls-Royce is responding to this urgent priority with significant development efforts under way and will expand testing capability as a founding member of the new HGTC at Purdue’s campus in Indiana. Tom Bell, Chairman and CEO, Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce is proud to be the founding member of this significant new addition to aerospace research. We credit leadership from the state of Indiana, Purdue University and Purdue Research Foundation for their important vision and investment leading to the creation of the Hypersonics Ground Test Center. Rolls-Royce has a unique history in high-speed propulsion, dating to the Concorde aircraft and 30 years of experience on hypersonics research with our Department of Defense customers through our LibertyWorks advanced technology unit in Indianapolis. We are keenly interested in the area of hypersonic propulsion and currently exploring development of advanced supersonic and high-Mach propulsion systems with our customers.” The Purdue testing center will create additional capability for Rolls-Royce, to develop high-Mach propulsion systems, in a way that could not be done before. It will also allow our Department of Defense partners to accelerate the development of these new systems and technologies. The new announcement builds on a recently unveiled project between Rolls-Royce North America, Purdue University and the Purdue Research Foundation involving a multimillion dollar facility for hybrid-electric and altitude testing capabilities at Purdue. Altogether, the new projects will form a significant, large-scale testing campus at the Purdue Aerospace District, where Rolls-Royce already has an electronic controls facility and conducts advanced engine testing at the school’s Zucrow Propulsion Labs. Hypersonic flight is an area of growing interest within the aerospace field. Generally considered to be five times the speed of sound or higher, hypersonic flight presents considerable physical challenges such as extremely high-temperatures and significant pressures. The new test facility will allow industry and university researchers to address such challenges as aerospace programs develop. The new project also follows a Rolls-Royce North America investment of over $600 million in advanced manufacturing facilities and technology over the past six years in Indianapolis. Additional major investment in new testing facilities at the company’s Indianapolis site is expected to be announced in the near future, and Rolls-Royce recently committed to maintaining offices and employees in its downtown Indianapolis Meridian Center, utilizing an industry-leading approach to hybrid working. Rolls-Royce and its predecessor companies have been leading in aerospace innovation in Indianapolis for more than a century, and will continue to do so for decades to come as a result of ongoing investments. Rolls-Royce and Purdue have had a long-standing partnership for many years, have conducted aerospace research together, and the university has been officially designated as a Rolls-Royce University Technology Partnership. The company employs hundreds of Purdue engineers.",

		"text": "Former MB&T clock was installed in 1917 By Tom Adamich View Comments A few months back, I wrote about one of Monroe most interesting historical assets – the chime clock that graces the front of the First Merchants Bank building at 102 East Front Street in Monroe. As I mentioned back at the time, the well-engineered clock is a rare piece of 20th Century Americana that has, miraculously and with the help of thoughtful care by the good people currently at First Merchants and previously -- survived. It takes all of us, young and not-so-young, back to a day when publicly viewed clocks were commonplace and a source of community unity and civic pride. In the months since the article was written, First Merchants officials made the wise and thoughtful decision to pursue a clock restoration project – a painstaking process that involves clock historians and clock restoration technicians working to bring the First Merchants chime clock back to its former glory. First Merchants engaged the efforts of Fred Stark of The Public Clock, based in Indiana to oversee as well as work directly on aspects of the First Merchants project. Stark has been President of The Public Clock, Inc. since its formation in 2016. He has been involved in collecting and repairing clocks since 1995 and currently serves as Treasurer of the NAWCC - National Association of Watch and Clock Collectors - Tower Clock Chapter. Fred is the retired Chief Technical Officer of Rolls-Royce Corporation in Indianapolis, Ind. His partner is John Vinzant, who co-created The Public Clock, Inc. with Fred Stark. He has collected and repaired clocks since 1996 and is an active member of the NAWCC. John is Vice President of Vinzant Software, Inc. in Hobart, Indiana. One of the most gratifying outcomes of the clock forensic research that Stark, Vinzant, and their team discovered was verifying that the First Merchants Chime clock is, indeed a McClintock-Loomis clock -- manufactured before the clock was installed by the Monroe State Savings Bank in October, 1917 in front of its location in the Loranger Building at the corner of Front and Monroe Streets in Monroe. During a recent conversation with Stark, he said, “In 1908, O.B. McClintock founded, with Freeman L. Loomis, the McClintock -Loomis Company. McClintock was President and Treasurer, and Loomis was the Vice-President. The McClintock-Loomis Company made electrical chime and clock systems. Loomis eventually left the company in 1917, and the company was renamed the O.B. McClintock Company. Stark added, “By examining the clock's glass dial, one can determine which of the two time periods it was manufactured. Clocks bearing the McClintock-Loomis names were made between 1908 and 1917. Clocks bearing only the McClintock name were made after 1917. Another identifying characteristic is the artful graphic design that surrounds the perimeter of the clock face. Stark provided photos of the First Merchants chime clock and a reference graphic Stark took from an NAWCC publication which shows that the design on the First Merchants clock matches the design used on McClintock-Loomis clocks. Still another fascinating aspect of the First Merchants chime clock restoration is that Stark, Vinzant, and the team were able to restore the mechanical chime peals to play the Westminster tone at the top of the hour. This is in contrast to the route many recent clock restorers have taken to replace clock mechanical sound components with technology that plays a digital recording of the chimes. Thanks to Stark, Vinzant, and First Merchants officials, the First Merchants chime clock has been restored in a manner honoring its original craftsmanship and prominence in the Monroe community. I will share more details about the clock restoration and other perspectives in future columns. Tom Adamich is President – Visiting Librarian Service, a firm he has operated since 1993. He also is Project Archivist for the Greening Nursery Company and Family Archives. ",

Company executives say the investment in new equipment, modernizing and reconfiguring of its Indianapolis manufacturing facilities is the largest Rolls-Royce has ever made in the United States. Indianapolis budget: Takeaways from the 2022 Indianapolis city budget, including new emergency services agency First announced in 2015 , the modernization program aims to increase efficiency at Rolls-Royce's Indianapolis operations on Tibbs Avenue and West Raymond Street. Officials say it will improve the company's ability to be competitive in the marketplace and put it on course to become net-zero in carbon use by 2030. The renovation introduced new AI technologies at Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities and reduced the company's footprint at the operations centers from about three million square feet to 1.5 million square feet. The company demolished and recycled large swaths of the campus, parts of which date back to World War II, on Raymond Street. The company, which employs about 3,500 workers in Indianapolis, says the overhaul did not result in the layoff of workers. “Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities feature brand-new advanced manufacturing equipment, new and efficient processes, increased flexibility in operations, and have enhanced our ability to pivot to the future in a highly efficient manner,\" Phil Burkholder, executive vice president of global manufacturing, assembly and test at Rolls-Royce Defense. Rolls-Royce manufactures engines for aircrafts and ships, primarily for U.S. military customers. It's currently pursuing a contract to build hundreds of engines for U.S. Air Force bombers worth an estimated $1 billion A successful bid means the construction of 650 engines for the Air Force's fleet of B-52s, which would require a new assembly line at its Tibbs Avenue plant. The aerospace company reached agreement with Texas-based Bell Textron Inc. to provide the propulsion system for the V-280 Valor aircraft and is competing to win a contract with the U.S. Army’s future long-range assault aircraft competition. \"The facilities we were in were made in the '40s and '50s (for) the most part, and so it's a revitalization certainly in the building infrastructure and fabric, but that alone isn't enough,\" Warren White, head of assembly and testing at Rolls-Royce Defense, said during a media tour on Tuesday. \"The world is competitive. Our commercial customers — from the Department of Defense and other partners, industry partners — demand our best.\" It is hoped that the investment in the modernization program would position Rolls-Royce to compete for and win more contracts. Rolls-Royce celebrated the overhaul's conclusion at a ceremony attended by Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb and Indianapolis Mayor Joe Hogsett Wednesday afternoon. Rolls-Royce installed new technology in three buildings known as Excellence, Performance and Victory. It also removed old technology. Artificial Intelligence in Rolls-Royce's computer systems permit company to make more precise parts, reducing opportunities for error. Earlier this month, the company announced plans to expand its footprint at Purdue University with the construction of three new testing facilities for high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines.

		"text": "|Published: August 2021| Rolls-Royce North America has completed a major revitalization program, creating a high-tech, revolutionary advanced manufacturing campus, setting the stage for future growth and securing the company’s footprint in Indianapolis, US. The six-year modernization program included over $600 million of investments in facilities and technology and has transformed manufacturing capabilities at the Rolls-Royce Indianapolis Operations Center. The revitalized facilities are highly efficient and will improve competitiveness in an increasingly contested marketplace for propulsion and power solutions. The modernized facilities have already significantly improved energy efficiency and helped Rolls-Royce in its journey to become net-zero in carbon use in operations by 2030. Tom Bell, Chairman and CEO, Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce has been innovating in Indianapolis for decades to serve our customers. Now, we take a major technological leap into the future with facilities that are among the most advanced and efficient of any Rolls-Royce site, anywhere in the world. We thank all those who have supported us in this journey, including leaders from the state of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and our federal representatives in Washington, D.C.” Phil Burkholder, Rolls-Royce Defense, Executive Vice President, Global Manufacturing, Assembly and Test, said, “Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities feature brand-new advanced manufacturing equipment, new and efficient processes, increased flexibility in operations, and have enhanced our ability to pivot to the future in a highly efficient manner. The new facilities also elevate digital engineering and robotics capabilities to maximize operations throughout the manufacturing campus. We look forward to delivering the benefits of these improvements to our customers every day.” Eric J. Holcomb, Governor of Indiana, said, “Rolls-Royce has been an integral part of Indiana’s manufacturing industry for more than 100 years, contributing to our status as the strongest manufacturing state in the nation. Days like today, where we get to celebrate a major investment and revitalization of manufacturing operations, are proof that Indiana is on a roll, exactly because of Rolls-Royce’s continuing commitment to powering the future from right here in the heart of the heartland.” Joe Hogsett, Mayor of Indianapolis, said, “We’re excited to celebrate this latest major addition to Rolls-Royce in Indianapolis, which affirms one of our community’s most important businesses at the cutting edge of its field. Today’s announcement joins a long and proud lineage among other banner days in our city’s relationship with this company, and sets up an even stronger partnership in the years to come.” The revitalization program began in 2015, with a vision to transform aging, World War II era manufacturing buildings into the most modern and advanced manufacturing capabilities anywhere. Three primary operations buildings – known as Excellence, Performance and Victory – were upgraded through a carefully orchestrated process in which new technology was designed and installed, and old manufacturing equipment was removed — while continuing to deliver engines and products to customers without interruption. Additionally, inefficient buildings dating to 1942 were removed, resulting in a smaller footprint but much greater manufacturing capability. Rolls-Royce continues planning for new test capabilities on the Indianapolis campus to support military engine production, with an announcement expected in the future. Rolls-Royce Indianapolis primarily serves US military customers, manufacturing engines and components for the C-130J Super Hercules, V-22 Osprey, E-2 Hawkeye, Global Hawk and Triton, F-35B Lightning II, and other military aircraft. The site also produces engines and power components for the US Navy, industrial power generation, commercial aircraft, and helicopter customers.",

Rolls-Royce North America has completed a $600m modernisation programme at its Indianapolis campus in the US state of Indiana. The six-year programme involved upgrading the facilities at the site and enhancing manufacturing capabilities at the Rolls-Royce Indianapolis Operations Center. The modernisation will also improve energy efficiency, aligned with Rolls-Royce’s plans to achieve net-zero emissions in operations by 2030. Rolls-Royce Defense Global Manufacturing, Assembly and Test executive vice-president Phil Burkholder said: “Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities feature brand-new advanced manufacturing equipment, new and efficient processes, increased flexibility in operations, and have enhanced our ability to pivot to the future in a highly efficient manner. “The new facilities also elevate digital engineering and robotics capabilities to maximise operations throughout the manufacturing campus. We look forward to delivering the benefits of these improvements to our customers every day.” According to the Rolls-Royce website, Indianapolis hosts four businesses, namely Defense, LibertyWorks, Civil Small & Medium Engines, Marine and Helicopters. The site employs more than 4,000 employees. Indianapolis manufactures engines and components for the C-130J Super Hercules, V-22 Osprey, E-2 Hawkeye, Global Hawk and Triton, F-35B Lightning II and other military aircraft among other works. Under the revitalisation programme, three primary operations buildings called Excellence, Performance and Victory were upgraded with new equipment and technology.

The revitalised facilities are highly efficient and will improve competitiveness in an increasingly contested marketplace for propulsion and power solutions. The modernised facilities have already significantly improved energy efficiency and helped Rolls-Royce in its journey to become net-zero in carbon use in operations by 2030. Tom Bell, Chairman and CEO, Rolls-Royce North America, said: “Rolls-Royce has been innovating in Indianapolis for decades to serve our customers. Now, we take a major technological leap into the future with facilities that are among the most advanced and efficient of any Rolls-Royce site, anywhere in the world. We thank all those who have supported us in this journey, including leaders from the state of Indiana, the city of Indianapolis and our federal representatives in Washington, D.C.” Phil Burkholder, Rolls-Royce Defense, Executive Vice President, Global Manufacturing, Assembly and Test, said: “Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities feature brand-new advanced manufacturing equipment, new and efficient processes, increased flexibility in operations and have enhanced our ability to pivot to the future in a highly efficient manner. The new facilities also elevate digital engineering and robotics capabilities to maximise operations throughout the manufacturing campus. We look forward to delivering the benefits of these improvements to our customers every day.” Eric J. Holcomb, Governor of Indiana, said: “Rolls-Royce has been an integral part of Indiana’s manufacturing industry for more than 100 years, contributing to our status as the strongest manufacturing state in the nation. Days like today, where we get to celebrate a major investment and revitalisation of manufacturing operations, are proof that Indiana is on a roll, exactly because of Rolls-Royce’s continuing commitment to powering the future from right here in the heart of the heartland.” Joe Hogsett, Mayor of Indianapolis, said: “We’re excited to celebrate this latest major addition to Rolls-Royce in Indianapolis, which affirms one of our community’s most important businesses at the cutting edge of its field. Today’s announcement joins a long and proud lineage among other banner days in our city’s relationship with this company, and sets up an even stronger partnership in the years to come.” The revitalisation programme began in 2015, with a vision to transform aging, World War II era manufacturing buildings into the most modern and advanced manufacturing capabilities anywhere. Three primary operations buildings – known as Excellence, Performance and Victory - were upgraded through a carefully orchestrated process in which new technology was designed and installed and old manufacturing equipment was removed, whilst continuing to deliver engines and products to customers without interruption. Additionally, inefficient buildings dating to 1942 were removed, resulting in a smaller footprint but much greater manufacturing capability. Rolls-Royce continues planning for new test capabilities on the Indianapolis campus to support military engine production, with an announcement expected in the future. Rolls-Royce Indianapolis primarily serves US military customers, manufacturing engines and components for the C-130J Super Hercules, V-22 Osprey, E-2 Hawkeye, Global Hawk and Triton, F-35B Lightning II and other military aircraft. The site also produces engines and power components for the US Navy, industrial power generation, commercial aircraft and helicopter customers.",

		"text": "WEST LAFAYETTE — Rolls-Royce — the aerospace manufacturing giant, not the car maker — will expand its already large footprint at Purdue University West Lafayette, thanks to a new commitment among the university, the Purdue Research Foundation and the company. The enhanced partnership, announced Aug. 2, calls for Rolls-Royce to further expand its facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District, which is adjacent to the university. The new test facilities will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines to power the next generation of U.S. military aircraft. Rolls-Royce West Lafayette will be developed through a multimillion-dollar investment from the research foundation, Purdue University and Rolls-Royce North America, according to a news release from Purdue. “Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,” Purdue President Mitch Daniels said in a news release. “With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls-Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.” Rolls-Royce already has facilities focusing on digital engine controls and conducts advanced technology engine research at Purdue’s Zucrow Laboratories in the district. It’s part of a longstanding partnership between the company and university spanning several decades of conducting aerospace research. The company also employs hundreds of Purdue engineers. The facility will enable Rolls-Royce North America to continue providing full-service advanced design, development, production and aftermarket support of world-leading propulsion solutions. Tom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America, said in a statement, “Rolls-Royce has a proud history of supporting our U.S. military and commercial customers, and this new significant investment will continue to grow our capability to serve our customers. This reflects yet another major investment in Indiana, and we are also planning significant upgrades to test facilities at our Indianapolis manufacturing campus, which has benefited from a recently completed $600 million modernization program to grow advanced manufacturing and technology capability. We thank both local and state governments for their ongoing support.” Mung Chiang, Purdue’s executive vice president for strategic initiatives and the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering, said testing to be conducted by Rolls-Royce will substantially advance national security. “Today’s announcement is pivotal for two reasons,” Chiang said in a statement. “It represents the largest single economic development success to our neighborhood with Rolls-Royce colleagues and the largest research collaboration with a private-sector partner. It also advances the excellence at scale by Purdue in creating the epicenter of aerospace engineering R&D in the U.S.” Theresa Mayer, Purdue University executive vice president for research and partnerships, said in a statement, “We look forward to having deeper engagement with Rolls-Royce as part of Purdue’s rapidly growing defense research and technology ecosystem. The researchers working in these facilities will be able to leverage the deep expertise of our faculty and staff, as well as our new and existing facilities for research, design, testing and evaluation.” Brian Edelman, Purdue Research Foundation president, said the investment fits the foundation’s goal to advance the mission of Purdue University. “The foundation supports President Daniels’ vision to establish the university as a leader among institutes of higher education in the realm of national security,” Edelman said in a statement. “The investment to expand Rolls-Royce’s presence in the Purdue Aerospace District is a strategic one that will make the vision become a reality, and lead to more actions in the same initiative. The generous support from Lafayette, Greater Lafayette Commerce, West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County provides another example of the strong ecosystem we are building with community, university and corporate partners.”",

		"text": "Rolls-Royce, ChefsFridge Co. to develop ultra-low temperature pod for transportation and storage of covid-19 vaccines Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge Co. have teamed up to develop an innovative, ultra-low temperature pod to transport and store Covid-19 vaccines globally to meet the challenge of vaccinating patients around the world in nearly any environment. The new ArcticRx system will help bridge the gap in the cold chain currently challenging the global vaccination effort. ArcticRx is a passive, stable, long-term ultra-low temperature (ULT) pod — the first of its kind to support a two-dose vaccine delivery regimen specifically targeting rural, remote and international areas supporting global equitable access and help share doses as rapidly and quickly as possible. Allen Barta, Rolls-Royce, Emerging Technologies and Innovation Lead, said, “This new vaccine delivery system developed jointly by Rolls-Royce and ChefsFridge will solve the significant technological challenge of maintaining extremely low vaccine temperatures. Vaccines need to be kept ultra cold and for long enough to transport them worldwide – not just one, but two doses of vaccines. Rolls-Royce is proud to bring our innovation to bear on this difficult and crucial challenge, and join ChefsFridge in the global fight against the Covid-19 pandemic.” The ArcticRx pod was designed by Rolls-Royce innovators in Indianapolis and developed with ChefsFridge, also based nearby. The collaboration has led to a final design, with three models manufactured and tested. With the ability to scale quickly with funding, ChefsFridge Co. is currently seeking investment and manufacturing partners as the team moves forward to market. As COVID-19 vaccines began to roll out, gaps were found in the system for transporting and storing the doses of vaccines. Current solutions are still expensive, bulky, and inaccessible to many regions without resources like electricity and ultra-low temperature storage at vaccination sites. Most current shipping coolers can only carry one of two rounds of doses at a time, causing logistics and sustainability issues. The ArcticRx is reusable, lightweight, and does not require electricity to maintain stable ultra-low temperatures required for mRNA vaccines. ArcticRx can be refilled with additional cooling materials. Rolls-Royce engineers in the company’s LibertyWorks advanced technology unit in Indianapolis designed the system to solve the challenge. The company then connected with ChefsFridge, a company creating an asynchronous meal-sharing platform along with exact temperature-controlled kiosks to provide a 365/24/7 neighbourhood-focused food sharing. Stuart Lowry, ChefsFridge co-founder, said, “From the beginning, it seemed a natural fit for our creative approach at ChefsFridge Co. The passion from the team at Rolls-Royce melded seamlessly with our energy for creating a way to help with the pandemic, using the toolbox of cooling engineers, innovation, and the build-it-from-scratch approach. It was not only exciting, but possibly revolutionary, in terms of solving this vital cold chain issue.” - Shane Bivens, ChefsFridge co-founder, said, “People think the problem is over, but we’re not even close. Initially, we’re looking at immediate global challenges that need to be met. With the help we’re seeking from additional investors and manufacturing partners, the possibilities from this point are enormous for both solving this current pandemic, and shipping and storing other vital medical and non-medical supplies. There are so many life-improving medications pharma leaves on the shelf because stable cold chain transportation for extended periods did not previously exist to move product around the globe.”",

		"text": "These bazillion-dollar antiques are mostly traditional, but with a few surprises thrown in. Most years in the late summer, except for last year, rich people and their cars get together to celebrate. The Pebble Beach Concours d'Elegance went off without a hitch this past weekend (we're guessing besides a few overheated cars that needed to be trailered out of there) crowing a winner in the one-of-a-kind 1938 Mercedes-Benz 540K Autobahn Kurier. It was the kind of traditional pre-war winner we expect, though it has a bit of a dicey past. Then again, there's not much from Germany in the 1930s that doesn't have a dicey past. In celebration of the weekend's festivities, we're bringing you all the winners. The Autobahn Kurier won Best In Show and is currently owned by collector and restorer Arturo Keller, who's had several vehicles take the top spot at the most famous concours. It was joined in the final four by a 1957 Maserati 450S Zagato Coupe, a 1967 Ferrari 365 Pininfarina Tre Posti, and the 1935 Bugatti Type 57C Convertible. It also won it's own Mercedes Pre-War class. The Kurier was bought new in 1938 in Barcelona. It then moved to Africa, Switzerland, and then back to Barcelona. The original owner kept the Mercedes the rest of his life. It was then sold it to Keller, who restored it. And they didn't just put it in a bubble, never to be seen again. Keller and his wife Deborah instead drove the 540K, even driving it from Monte Carlo to Venice over Alpine passes. Keller won way back in 1986 with a 1936 500K Special Roadster, and again in 2001 with a 1930 700SS Erdmann & Rossi Roadster. Both are Mercedes vehicles. This 1910 Winton won best in the antique class. It's owned by the Schuster family and originally came from the Winton Motor Carriage company that operated in Cleveland, Ohio. It made \"touring\" cars from the late 1800s to 1924, and was eventually bought by General Motors. From what we can gather, its 7.8-liter straight-six engine made about 48 horsepower when new, put to the wheels via a four-speed transmission. This 1912 Rauch & Lang won the Early Electric Vehicles class at Pebble. The EV was also produced in Cleveland, Ohio where the company made its home. It operated from 1905 to 1920 and produced hundreds of thousands of quiet little carriages. This one was owned by inventor Thomas A. Edison himself. The TC4 features a unique layout with an exposed chauffeur seat and a tall passenger cabin like a horse-drawn carriage. This 3-35 won the Vintage class with owners Timothy and Dennis Heywood. It was produced from 1916-1923 and featured a 424-cu-in. V12 (hence the 'Twin Six' name). It's three-speed manual transmission had been moved from the rear axle to the back of the clutch, leading to smoother acceleration with its 88 hp. This 1933 Auburn 12-161A Speedster is like Pebble Beach bait. The judges love this brand and it won the American Classic class. One of these recently sold for almost a half million dollars at auction. It features a 391-cu-in. Lycoming Side-Valve V12 engine, a single Stromberg carburetor and delivered 160 hp at 3,500 rpm. Here's more Packard magic, in a class full of Packards. The 1407 Twelve was offered in many different body styles including several different four-door sedans configurations. It housed a 473.3-cu-in. twelve-cylinder under the hood with four main bearings and Stromberg-Duplex carburetor making 175 hp at 3,200 RPM. A three-speed selective synchromesh transmission kept the gear changes smooth. This J Murphy Dual Cowl Phaeton won this year's Duesenberg class. If you're unfamiliar with Duesenberg, it was an American company that made luxury and race cars from 1916 to 1937. They're long, rare, and expensive, and they win a lot of awards. One of these sold recently for $2 million at an RM Sotheby's auction. 265 horsepower is brought forth by a 420 cubic inch inline eight, which more than doubled the output of any rival at the time. Long before the current Rolls-Royce Ghost , we had the Silver Ghost, and this one won the Rolls-Royce class. They call this a Skiff body, and it was coachbuilt by Shapiro-Schebera in Berlin. It has a a 7.4-liter L-Head inline-six cylinder engine making just 50 hp at 1,500 rpm with a four-speed manual transmission. One sold for over $1.1 million at Bonhams in 2015. This 1937 Bugatti Type 57S joined the Bugatti Bolide out at the 70th Pebble Beach Concours. It won the European Classic class and looks stunning its its period-correct two-tone paint. The Type 57 and its variants was an entirely new design created by Jean Bugatti, son of founder Ettore. Only 710 examples were ever produced and these days they sell for millions. Alfa Romeo made the 6C from 1927 all the way to 1954. It utilized engines ranging from 1.5- to 3.0-liters. This one sported a 2.5-liter (2,443-cc) I6 making about 95 hp with a single carburetor. Top speed was 96 mph. This 2500 S Touring Coupe was one of the few hundred that were built between 1940 and 1945, before production stopped during wartime. This Packard also featured a V12. Dietrich was a coachbuilder, who was joined by LeBaron for the Tenth Series vehicles. Packard changed the name from Twin Six to make sure its customers understood how many cylinders they were actually getting. Its 445-cu-in. side-valve twelve was refined, quiet and powerful with 160 hp on tap. Though the Pebble photo crew is calling this a 917PA Spyder, we're pretty sure its Porsche 917K that was raced at Le Mans by Helmut Marko. Only two 917 PA Spyders were ever built, and they didn't have a roof. The 917K got those vertical fins and a less upswept tail. It was both more attractive than the previous model and maintained more downforce at speed. It features a 4.5-liter flat-12-cylinder engine making more than 500 hp, in a car that weighs well under 2,000 pounds. The Ferrari 275 GTB was a two-seat grand touring coupe produced between 1964 and 1966. The engine's per-cylinder displacement was 275 cc, hence the name. It came and the Italian designation Gran Turismo Berlinetta and used a 3.3 liter Colombo-designed 60º V12 engine. Output was claimed to be 280 hp, though it was found to have less in actual use, according to an article in Cavallino. It was rear-wheel drive and had a five-speed manual. This 1964 example of the Ferrari 250 GTO took top honors in one of the several Ferrari classes. The 250 GTO was produced 1962 to 1964 for homologation into the FIA's Group 3 Grand Touring Car category. It was powered by Ferrari's Colombo V12 engine while the name denotes the displacement in cubic centimeters of each of its cylinders. Just 36 of the 250 GTOs were manufactured between 1962 and 1964. This particular one had its bodywork modified by Scaglietti and was part of the Series II model line. The Iso Grifo didn't begin production until 1965, hence this prototype winning the Iso class. It was intended to compete with the grand touring Ferraris and Maseratis of the world, but never quite made it. The funny thing about these cars is that they all worked with American engines under the hood. Early ones, including this prototype, had a 340-hp Chevy 327. Race versions got a 454. This particular example wears a coachbuilt body by Bertone and is the only prototype in existence. It was originally restored in the late 1980s by a Pebble Beach Concours judge. The Porsche 904 debuted after the company withdrew from Formula 1 to focus on sports cars. The GTS model was created to compete in FIA-GT motorsport classes. Based on the Porsche 718, it inherited a mid-engine layout, making it a predecessor to the modern 718 Cayman. It housed a Type 906 2.0-liter flat-four engine eventually making around 180 hp. A 904 won the Targa Florio race and at Le Mans. This 1956 Maserati A6G won the Postwar Sport class. It was bodied by Zagato, who's made some pretty interesting vehicles lately , and sported a 2.0-liter inline-six with triple carburetors. According to ClassicDriver, in just over three years, 60 A6G/54 GTs were produced with coupé and spyder bodywork by Frua, Allemano and Zagato - the latter making just 20 of the lightest, most competition-focused cars. This 1957 Cadillac Eldorado Brougham Fleetwood took home the crown in the Postwar Touring class. When new, this car cost about $13,000, equivalent to about $126,000 today. To build it, GM designer Harley Earl put together the styling of a couple of show cars for the Brougham, and the result is stunning. Only built over a two-year span, each Brougham was built by hand and featured air suspension and a 365-cubic-inch V8. It was luxurious for the era and was the first car to feature a two-position memory function for the power seats. In the Pinin Farina Pre-War category, this Lancia Astura won first place. The 1938 drop top was one of only 423 Series IV Asturas built between 1937 and 1939, and various coachbuilders designed their own bodies. It's not known how many Pinin Farina bodies were built. It was only offered in long-wheelbase form and in this Series IV guise, it was powered by an 82-hp 3.0-liter V8. This isn't the first time an Astura Pinin Farina Cabriolet has been successful at Pebble Beach, as a 1936 version once owned by Eric Clapton won the Best of Show Award in 2016. Another Pinin class winner, the Aurelia debuted at the Turin Motor Show in the spring of 1952. , Pinin Farina premiered a new car built on a Lancia B52 Aurelia chassis. It has Jet Age styling, a raked windshield and pontoon-style fenders. It made 90 hp with a 1,991-cc V6 with dual Weber carburetors and a four-speed manual rear-mounted transaxle. The 375 America was introduced was built as a successor to the 342 America and used the new 4.5-liter Lampredi designed V12. It produced up to 296 hp at 6,300 rpm, with three Weber carburetors. Top speed was almost 160 mph, lighting at the time. Twelve cars were made, with the majority having either three or five-window coupe bodies by Pinin Farina. This one won the Pinin Farina Ferrari Early Class. This 1966 Ferrari 365 P was one of the final four in contention for best in show. It'll have to contend with a class win of the Pininfarina Ferrari Late class instead. It featured a midengined layout and a central driving position like the McLaren F1 . The exterior design was loosely based on the Dino concept, with Aldo Brovarone of Pininfarina credited as the Berlinetta Speciale designer. Another winner in the Porsche 917 class, the K stands for kurzheck or 'short-tail'. The 917 L was the long tail. These cars won the 24 Hours of Le Mans, and were plenty famous even before Steve McQueen's Le Mans movie debuted. They regularly change hands for more than $10 million. Only three Ferrari 340 Mexico Vignale Berlinetta were made, purpose built to contest 1952 Carrera Panamericana. Its single overhead cam V8 displaced just over four liters and made 280 hp. It had three Weber carburetors, a five-speed manual transmission and an independent front suspension. One sold for $3.6 million ten years ago at RM Sotheby's. Finally, after 50 years, a Countach gets recognized at Pebble Beach, although it may have something to do with the new Countach premiering at the event, and a special 50th anniversary class being established to celebrate. This LP400 was bodied by famous coachbuilder Bertone and the color is called Verde Metallizzato. It houses a 365-hp 3.9-liter DOHC V12 with six dual-throat Weber carburetors and a five-speed manual transmission. In the Miller class, this 91 Perfect Circle took home the crown. In the late 1920s it was dominant in American racing, usually filling more than half the grid at the Indianapolis 500. It won the event outright in 1926, 1928 and 1929.

		"text": "Partners Planning Next-Gen Military Aircraft Testing Aerospace engine manufacturing giant Rolls-Royce will expand its already large footprint at Purdue, thanks to a new commitment among the university, the Purdue Research Foundation , and the company. The enhanced partnership calls for Rolls-Royce to further expand its facilities in the Purdue Aerospace District, which is adjacent to the university. The new test facilities will be used to develop high-altitude and hybrid-electric engines to power the next generation of U.S. military aircraft. Rolls-Royce West Lafayette will be developed through a multimillion-dollar investment from the research foundation, Purdue University and Rolls-Royce North America. The partnership is a major win for the national security and technology pillar of Purdue’s Next Moves , announced by President Mitch Daniels and Purdue trustees in April. “Purdue is delivering new, one-of-a-kind facilities that are national assets and will further differentiate the university as a state and national leader in securing and defending our country,” Daniels said. “With this vital partnership and support from our good friends at Rolls-Royce and others, we continue to expand our role as the economic engine for this region of Indiana and beyond.” Rolls-Royce already has facilities focusing on digital engine controls and conducts advanced technology engine research at Purdue’s Zucrow Laboratories in the district. It’s part of a longstanding partnership between the company and university spanning several decades of conducting aerospace research. The company also employs hundreds of Purdue engineers. The facility will enable Rolls-Royce North America to continue its legacy of providing full-service advanced design, development, production and aftermarket support of world-leading propulsion solutions. Tom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America, said, “Rolls-Royce has a proud history of supporting our U.S. military and commercial customers, and this new significant investment will continue to grow our capability to serve our customers. This reflects yet another major investment in Indiana, and we are also planning significant upgrades to test facilities at our Indianapolis manufacturing campus, which has benefited from a recently completed $600 million modernization program to grow advanced manufacturing and technology capability. We thank both local and state governments for their ongoing support.” Mung Chiang, Purdue’s executive vice president for strategic initiatives and the John A. Edwardson Dean of the College of Engineering, said testing to be conducted by Rolls-Royce will substantially advance national security. “Today’s announcement is pivotal for two reasons,” Chiang said. “It represents the largest single economic development success to our neighborhood with Rolls-Royce colleagues and the largest research collaboration with a private-sector partner. It also advances the excellence at scale by Purdue in creating the epicenter of aerospace engineering R&D in the U.S.” Theresa Mayer, Purdue University executive vice president for research and partnerships, said, “We look forward to having deeper engagement with Rolls-Royce as part of Purdue’s rapidly growing defense research and technology ecosystem. The researchers working in these facilities will be able to leverage the deep expertise of our faculty and staff, as well as our new and existing facilities for research, design, testing and evaluation.” Brian Edelman, Purdue Research Foundation president, said the investment fits PRF’s goal to advance the mission of Purdue University. “The foundation supports President Daniels’ vision to establish the university as a leader among institutes of higher education in the realm of national security,” Edelman said. “The investment to expand Rolls-Royce’s presence in the Purdue Aerospace District is a strategic one that will make the vision become a reality, and lead to more actions in the same initiative. The generous support from Lafayette, Greater Lafayette Commerce, West Lafayette and Tippecanoe County provides another example of the strong ecosystem we are building with community, university and corporate partners.”",

		"text": "INDIANAPOLIS—In August, Roll-Royce completed a six-year, $600 million modernization of its manufacturing campus in Indianapolis. The revitalized campus is now highly efficient and will improve competitiveness in an increasingly contested marketplace for aircraft propulsion and power equipment. The energy efficiency of the buildings has also been improved significantly and will help Rolls-Royce achieve its goal of net-zero carbon emissions in operations by 2030.\n“Rolls-Royce has been innovating in Indianapolis for decades to serve,” says Tom Bell, chairman and CEO of Rolls-Royce North America. “Now, we take a major technological leap into the future with facilities that are among the most advanced and efficient of any Rolls-Royce site in the world.”\n“Rolls-Royce Indianapolis facilities feature brand-new advanced manufacturing equipment, new and efficient processes, increased flexibility in operations, and an enhanced ability to pivot to the future in a highly efficient manner,” adds Phil Burkholder, executive vice president for global manufacturing, assembly and test of Rolls-Royce Defense. “The new facilities also elevate digital engineering and robotics capabilities to maximize operations throughout the manufacturing campus.”\nThe revitalization program began in 2015, with a vision to transform aging, World War II era manufacturing buildings into a modern and advanced manufacturing facilities. Three buildings were upgraded through a carefully orchestrated process in which new technology was designed and installed, and old manufacturing equipment was removed, even as the campus continued to deliver engines and other products without interruption.\nAdditionally, inefficient buildings dating to 1942 were removed, resulting in a smaller footprint but much greater manufacturing capability.\nThe Indianapolis campus primarily serves U.S. military customers, manufacturing engines and components for the C-130J Super Hercules, V-22 Osprey, E-2 Hawkeye, Global Hawk and Triton, F-35B Lightning II, and other military aircraft. The site also produces engines and power components for the U.S. Navy, industrial power generation, commercial aircraft, and helicopter customers.",

		"text": "Home The Butler University Alumni Association is recognizing the achievements of eight alumni and one University instructor as part of the 2021 Alumni Awards. The nine individuals receiving this year’s awards have demonstrated extraordinary professional achievements, generous service to the University, and unwavering commitment to their communities. Award honorees will be recognized at a special Alumni Recognition Ceremony on Friday, September 10, during Butler’s annual Homecoming festivities. This year’s program will also honor Alumni Award recipients who were recognized in 2020 but did not have the opportunity to attend an in-person ceremony. This year’s recipients are: Butler Medal: Max B. Schumacher ’54Max Schumacher ’54 celebrated his 60th season with the Indianapolis Indians baseball team in 2021. He began his baseball career as the team’s ticket manager in 1957 and became the general manager in 1961, a position he held for more than three decades. In 1997, he became chairman of the board. During this time, he oversaw the construction of Victory Field, an $18 million stadium that brought a new ballpark to downtown Indianapolis. Schumacher officially retired in 2016 but continues to serve as chairman emeritus of the team’s board and is a host in his suite during games. Schumacher’s work has been recognized by a number of professional and community organizations in Indianapolis and across the country. In 1988, he received the John H. Johnson President’s Award from Minor League Baseball, and in 1996, he was voted the American Association’s Executive of the Year following the successful completion of Victory Field. That same year, The Boys and Girls Clubs honored him with their Horatio Alger Award. Schumacher is also a two-time recipient of Indiana’s Sagamore of the Wabash award. He was named to the Indiana Baseball Hall of Fame in 2009. In 2012, he was inducted into the Shortridge High School Hall of Fame and was named an “Indiana Living Legend” by the Indiana Historical Society. Schumacher and his wife, Judith, are the parents of three sons, Bruce, Brian, and Mark, and one daughter, Karen. They have five grandchildren. The Butler Medal is the highest honor conferred by the Butler University Alumni Association. It recognizes individuals for a lifetime of distinguished service to either Butler University or their local community, while at the same time achieving a distinguished career in their chosen profession and attaining a regional—or even a national—reputation. Since 1959, this award has recognized individuals who have helped immeasurably toward perpetuating the University as a great educational and cultural institution and have had a profound influence on the course of Butler University. Butler Service Medal: Marvin L. RechtGenerations of Bulldogs remember Marvin Recht best as an Executive-in-Residence and instructor in the Lacy School of Business. From 1992 to 2017, Recht taught several business classes and was involved in several campus organizations. He provided a “lifetime guarantee” for his courses and encouraged former students to contact him about career-related questions. Outside the classroom, he served as faculty advisor for Mortar Board and the Student Conduct Board, as well as for the Delta Tau Delta, Lambda Chi Alpha, Phi Epsilon Pi, and Sigma Chi fraternities. He also served as an academic advisor and career mentor and was a First-Year Student Orientation Guide. Recht’s distinguished career in business began in 1957. After graduating from the University of Pittsburgh with a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration, he began his career with General Motors. During his time with GM, Recht worked in manufacturing, human resources, and other roles. In 1981, he completed GM’s executive program at the University of Virginia. Two years later, he came to Indianapolis to serve as director of human resources and communications at GM’s Allison Gas Turbine Division (now known as Rolls Royce PLC). After retiring in 1992, Recht began his role as Executive-in-Residence with the Lacy School of Business. He also established a HR consulting practice and served as a part-time consultant for DBM (now Lee Hecht Harrison), a career transition firm. A dedicated volunteer, he has served on a number of boards for local organizations, including the Rehabilitation Hospital of Indianapolis, the Eiteljorg Museum, and the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. He currently serves on the IU Health Foundation’s Patient Feedback Affairs Council. He lives in Carmel and enjoys spending time with his children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren. The Butler Service Medal, established by the Alumni Association in 2001, is the second-highest honor conferred by the Butler University Alumni Association and is reserved for recognition of emeriti faculty or retired faculty and staff (graduate or non-graduate).The recipient will have achieved a lifetime of distinguished service to Butler University and/or the community.Recipients will have helped to shape the past and future successes of Butler and therefore shown a profound influence.

		"text": "Manufacturing Engineer Derek Anti of Rolls-Royce Defense found advanced simulation helped refine machine programming to save time and money. (Provided by Rolls-Royce Defense) What makes an engineer is the ability to analyze a process that makes an excellent product—and find a cheaper way to do it. Staying competitive means always improving the process, and that was the challenge presented to Derek Anti. He is a manufacturing engineering technical specialist who improves CAM/CNC operations at Rolls-Royce Defense, Indianapolis.\n“In early 2020 it was clear we needed to increase throughput through our machining centers,” he explained. “Since machining center costs are a significant expense to our business, and there are hundreds of centers throughout our company, improving throughput even by 10 percent would be significant.” A secondary problem was consumable tooling costs were too high. Rolls-Royce Defense needed a way to find more efficient processes that both reduced time and extended tool life.\nIf this sounds familiar, it should. Reducing machining time and improving tool life are age-old challenges for machining professionals. What is new is how Anti went about significantly improving the process, using finite element driven toolpath analysis simulation from Third Wave Systems embedded in the company’s Siemens NX design and manufacturing software.\n“We did not understand enough in the machining process to correct it. We needed a better understanding when the tool met the metal,” Anti said. Using the tried-and-true method of cutting trials, consultations with tooling vendors and relying on experience and intuition was becoming expensive. Anti noted it sometimes takes between 60-80 engineer hours to fix machining problems, such as broken tools and chatter, not to mention wear and tear on the machining center itself. “It is no longer possible in today’s environment to rely on that from experienced machinists,” he said. The skill is quickly diminishing. “We needed a quicker, faster, more agile solution to solving these kinds of problems. Sometimes it takes years to prove out a machining process.”\nOne approach to a better understanding is analyzing the force of the tool on the workpiece, which rapidly changes over the toolpath, even when feeds and speeds are constant. Finding a way to understand those forces and optimize them meant improving cutting time and reducing tool breakage. “That is what CNC Force Optimization [techniques] do; they let you see what the tangential cutting force is as it is actually machining your part live.”\nBut how to do that? Enter Production Module from Third Wave Systems, Minneapolis, a machining toolpath analysis software that is driven by experimentally validated, FEA based material models, according to the developer. Third Wave Systems offers two packages, AdvantEdge and Production Module. AdvantEdge is the company’s flagship software, often used in designing cutting tools. Production Module, in contrast, is aimed at manufacturing engineers like Anti, who use tools designed by others. They neither have the time nor inclination to learn about the mathematics of finite element modeling, meshing, or numerical convergence.\nWhat Production Module supplies is an updated machining strategy, via a G-Code program, that reduces (as much as possible) force spikes and valleys. “Force is a direct result of feed rate and toolpath,” explained Anti, along with tool geometry and workpiece material. Production Module does not alter the toolpath needed to produce a part but puts in additional constraints along the toolpath.\n“What I mean by that is if you have a start point and end point for your program, and it is giving you some wacky forces in the middle, it will add additional (X, Y, Z) locations to tune the toolpath,” he explained. These are small changes, not affecting the geometry of the part, but enough to reduce sudden spikes in tangential force of the tool on the part or a sudden lack of it.\nIt also micro-manages the feed rate, adjusting it within the minute changes in the toolpath. This is somewhat novel, as it would be nearly impossible for a human to figure out and apply adjustments of such small changes in feed rate that would optimize the force.\nProduction Module adjusts many parameters, including those two. It does not affect spindle speed, so the spindle speed strategy that provides the best surface finish and avoids chatter and harmonics still has to be done by a human engineer. Anti also brought up another key point: the helix and rake angles of the cutting tool are imperative to make sure you get the right force outputs from the simulation. This is information not widely needed before now, so any user of Production Module needs to get that information from their tooling supplier. “Technical cutting tool data and the initial cutting toolpath are inputs to the simulation,” he said.\nRolls-Royce’s first test case of Production Module on a real-world problem was a controllable pitch propeller blade the company supplies to the U.S. Navy for the DDG-51 Arleigh Burke class destroyer. “Our best bang for the buck was to trial this on something that had a long run time. This was it. It had cycle times of 40-60 hours of machining per propeller on a five-axis PAMA horizontal milling machine,” Anti said. The initial goal was to reduce cycle time by 10 percent. What the project actually achieved was a 20-25 percent reduction in spindle time. “If you take something that takes 40 hours to run, and you take 25 percent and multiply that [across that product line demand], it adds up to $1 million [per year] of savings.”\nTracking consumable savings took a little more effort. Like many companies, Rolls-Royce tracks its tooling costs at the vending machine and tooling changes are prescribed in the process—say a plan that requires a change-out of a cutting insert every five parts. “In some legacy processes we are changing out inserts every two parts,” he said, or when the operator knows it has to be done. For this trial, Anti’s team ran a baseline operation without Production Module and tracked tool usage and wear.\nA further concern highlights his working relationship with Third Wave Systems. With any simulation, proper inputs such as material properties are vital to an outcome that can be trusted. While Third Wave Systems has an extensive library of material properties, the concern was that Third Wave Systems had never dealt with any marine or naval products, according to Anti. The propeller blade is made of a nickel/aluminum/bronze alloy. For this trial, Third Wave Systems took a sample and measured the material properties of the propeller blade, a process they are willing to do both for their customers and to add to their library.\nThe test case showed that in addition to controlling forces on the part, Production Module also reduced the air gap—where the spindle is running in air before reaching the start of the process and cutting metal.\nAnti projects that using toolpath analysis will eventually result in up to 40 percent spindle time savings. He also noted it is more useful in roughing operations, where tangential forces are greater, than in finishing operations.\nWhile any user of a CAD system can use Production Module, Rolls-Royce has used the integrated Siemens NX experience for over 15 years, according to Anti. The company uses a standard process flow from CAD to post-processing and archives the program into Teamcenter. “A digital thread or digital twin concept using Siemens is well established,” he said. “The Production Module from Third Wave Systems shows up as a button in the Siemens User Interface. So, as a manufacturing engineer, I don’t have to use another software and then import geometry and export back out. I open NX and there is a little launch icon in their UI, and you have the Third Wave Systems Production Module right there.”\nVynce Paradise, director of NX CAM product development for Siemens Digital Industries Software, noted, “One of the great capabilities of the NX model-based system across CAD, CAM, CMM, and other functions that build a digital thread is the availability of the open tools that enable our partners to closely integrate their specialist solutions.” In particular, he pointed out that Third Wave Systems’ applications for material-based CAE analysis of machining processes complement NX CAM’s own advanced capabilities. “It’s good to see that our customers like Rolls-Royce Defense are realizing such high value,” he said.\nFor more information about Rolls-Royce, go to www.rolls-royce.com .
